I completed a 16-week after-hours full-stack web development bootcamp with <a href="https://devmountain.com/" target="_blank">DevMountain</a> in Provo, UT. The course was project based with individualized and small group instruction. I learned how to think like a software engineer, build professional applications, and immerse myself in a path to becoming a developer.



I am a digital marketer and a budding web developer. I have 6+ years’ experience in email marketing and data analysis. I also have extensive experience with email deliverability, survey logic and execution, demand generation, marketing automation, and interactive marketing programs.<br><br>

Having just completed an intensive 16-week full-stack web development boot camp through <a href="https://devmountain.com/" target="_blank">DevMountain</a>, I’m looking to pivot into web development. The course was project based with individualized and small group instruction. I learned how to think like a software engineer, build professional applications, and immerse myself in a path to becoming a developer. As an up-and-coming web developer, I’m passionate and excited about learning and building upon my new skills.<br><br>

My ideal role is one that allows me to continue to nurture my new-found passion for coding. I am known for my ability to learn and contribute quickly and I’m confident I will be able to do so in almost any organization.<br><br>

I’m currently searching for opportunities in full-stack, front-end, or back-end web development.
